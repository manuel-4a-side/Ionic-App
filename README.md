Proof of Concept Conference App
==============

An hybrid mobile app developed using Ionic v1 and web technologies such as MapBox.

## Using this project

The app structure is a tabs structure where the main view will give you details of every page.

This app is for a technology conference, where you can read and remove events that you would like to assist, and also find the conference location, points of interest of the city, user geolocation and navigation so the user can know how to go to the conference or other point of interest.
